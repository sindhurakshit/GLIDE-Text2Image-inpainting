# Text-to-Image and In-Painting 
In this project a photorealistic image to text generation and inpainting systems is implemented using diffusion based generative models. The system uses pretrained Open AI GLIDE (Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing) and CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training).Please feel free to contact me for colab notebok of this system. 

This Colab have two key features 
## 1. Text2Image Generation
Photorealistic text-to-image generation

## 2. Interactive Inpainting
Interactive GUI for inpainting allows to play with a number of source images and changes in applied mask location, mask size along with different guiding text increases the fun and variety.
